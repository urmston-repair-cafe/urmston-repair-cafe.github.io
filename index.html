<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Repair Cafés are all about repairing things, with the goal to prevent throwing them away unnecessarily. At Urmston Repair Café we have a friendly team of volunteers who want to help fix your broken items. Bring them along to one of our events and we'll do our best to get them working again. We'll have a go at anything you bring in, but the things we specialise in are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Electrical appliances</li>
  <li>Computers</li>
  <li>Toys</li>
  <li>Tool and knife sharpening</li>
</ul>
